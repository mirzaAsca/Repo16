        <p>This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite
          a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.</p>

          <strong>On Programming</strong><br>
          <p>Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard.
            The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to
            introduce their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why language matters</strong><br>
          <p>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs looked something like this:</p>
          <pre>
                    <code>
                    <strong>
                    00110001 00000001 00000001
                    00110011 00000001 00000010
                    01010001 00001011 00000010
                    00100010 00000010 00001000
                    01000011 00000001 00000000
                    01000001 00000001 00000001
                    00010000 00000010 00000000
                    01100010 00000000 00000000
                    </strong>

          <p>Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which
            isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.</p>

      <article>
        <p>In this chapter, we will start to do things that can actually be called programming. We will expand our command
          of the JavaScript language beyond the nouns and sentence fragments we’ve seen so far, to the point where we can
          express meaningful prose.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Expressions and statements</strong><br>
            <p>In Chapter 1, we made values and applied operators to them to get new values. Creating values like this is
              the main substance of any JavaScript program. But that substance has to be framed in a larger structure
              to be useful. So that’s what we’ll cover next.</p>

      <header><strong>Functions</strong></header>
      <article>
        <p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value
          has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms,
          and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Defining a function</strong><br>
            <p>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. For example, this code
              defines square to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number:</p>
            <pre>
                             <code>
                                const square = function(x) {
                                    return x * x;
                                  };
                                  
                                  console.log(square(12));
                                  // → 144
                             </code>

      <article>
        <p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information
          require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more
          complex structures.</p>
